# DFlip_flop-DV
D Flip-Flop Design and Verification
  This project contains the design and Verification of a D Flip_flop using        System Verilog.
  I included RTL design and testbench with all components :                       Generator,Driver,Monitor,scoreboard.

  CHALLENGES FACED:
    When i working on Verification code for D flip-flop output not matching values by checking once clearly i didn't used triggers after that i fixed by handling events correctly.

TOOLS USED:
  To cross-check the output of the D Flip-Flop, I used three tools: ModelSim, Xilinx Vivado, and EDA Playground.
